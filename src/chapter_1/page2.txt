Pull Requests
Pull Requests are the heart of GitHub collaboration.

With a pull request you are proposing that your changes should be merged (pulled in) with the master.

Pull requests show content differences, changes, additions, and subtractions in colors (green and red).

As soon as you have a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
