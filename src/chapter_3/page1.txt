What is Agile? 

Agile is a project management approach developed as a more flexible and efficient way to get products to market.
The word ‘agile’ refers to the ability to move quickly and easily.

Therefore, an Agile approach enables project teams to adapt faster and easier compared to other project methodologies.

Many of today’s projects have more unknowns than a traditional project management methodology can adequately handle. This uncertainty makes it challenging to document requirements and adapt to changes successfully.

This guide will explain the Agile methodology, which projects will benefit from an Agile approach, and how to implement one effectively.
